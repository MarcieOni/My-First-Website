# My Favorites

This repository contains the code for a simple webpage showcasing some of my favorite places to visit. The webpage displays a list of images accompanied by brief descriptions of each location. Additionally, it includes another file that showcases "Emily's Favorite Things."

## Technologies Used

The webpage is built using HTML and styled with CSS.

## Installation and Setup

To run the webpage locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the HTML and CSS files directly.
2. Open the HTML file, `fav-places.html`, in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Upon opening the webpage, you will see a title, "Favy Places," followed by a description centered on the page. Below the description, you will find a list of images representing my favorite places. Each image is accompanied by a short caption.

In addition to the favorite places, there is another file included in the project, `my-fav-things.html`, which showcases "Emily's Favorite Things." This file can be accessed separately to explore Emily's preferences for "kether," "cats," and "books."
